# Project Design Record (PDR) - Flappy Goose

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Flappy Goose
**URL:** https://flappy-goose.vercel.app
**Repository:** https://github.com/EllaJane0/flappy-goose
**Created:** September 2025

## Description

Flappy Goose is a browser-based game inspired by the classic Flappy Bird, featuring a goose as the main character. The game is built using vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, deployed on Vercel for global accessibility.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5 Canvas, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub
- **Hosting:** Static site hosting

### File Structure
```

```

## Game Design

### Core Mechanics
1. **Player Control:** Spacebar or click to make the goose flap and gain altitude
2. **Physics:** Gravity constantly pulls the goose downward
3. **Obstacles:** Green pipes with gaps that the player must navigate through
4. **Scoring:** Points awarded for each pipe successfully passed
5. **Collision Detection:** Game ends when goose hits pipes or boundaries

### Visual Design
- **Theme:** Sky blue to green gradient background representing sky to ground
- **Character:** Golden goose with orange beak and black eye
- **Obstacles:** Green pipes (top and bottom)
- **UI:** Clean, simple interface with score display and game over screen

### Game States
1. **Start Screen:** Initial state waiting for player input
2. **Playing:** Active gameplay with physics and collision detection
3. **Game Over:** End state with final score and restart option

## Technical Implementation

### Canvas Rendering
- 400x600 pixel game canvas
- 60fps game loop using `requestAnimationFrame`
- Real-time rendering of game objects

### Game Physics
- Gravity: 0.6 units per frame
- Jump velocity: -12 units (upward)
- Pipe movement speed: 2 units per frame

### Collision Detection
- Boundary collision (top/bottom of canvas)
- Rectangular collision detection between goose and pipes
- Precise collision boundaries for fair gameplay

### Input Handling
- Keyboard support (Spacebar)
- Mouse click support
- Touch support for mobile devices

## Deployment Strategy

### Vercel Configuration
- Static site deployment
- Automatic deployments from GitHub main branch
- Global CDN distribution
- HTTPS by default

### Continuous Deployment
1. Code pushed to GitHub repository
2. Vercel automatically detects changes
3. Builds and deploys updated version
4. Available globally within minutes

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques
- Lightweight vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Efficient canvas rendering
- Minimal asset loading
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with HTML5 Canvas support
- Mobile-friendly responsive design
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
1. **Sound Effects:** Wing flap, collision, and background music
2. **High Score System:** Local storage for best scores
3. **Multiple Difficulty Levels:** Varying pipe speeds and gaps
4. **Power-ups:** Special abilities or temporary advantages
5. **Animations:** Smoother character animations and particle effects
6. **Themes:** Different visual themes and characters

### Technical Improvements
1. **Mobile Optimization:** Better touch controls and responsive scaling
2. **Performance Monitoring:** Analytics for gameplay metrics
3. **Progressive Web App:** Offline capability and app-like experience
4. **Multiplayer:** Real-time competition features

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. No persistent high score storage
2. Basic collision detection (rectangular)
3. No sound effects or background music
4. Limited visual animations

### Browser Support
- Requires HTML5 Canvas support
- JavaScript must be enabled
- Minimum screen resolution recommendations

## Maintenance & Updates

### Regular Maintenance
- Monitor Vercel deployment status
- Update dependencies as needed
- Performance optimization reviews
- Bug fixes and improvements

### Version Control
- All changes tracked in Git
- Feature branches for new development
- Main branch protected and deployment-ready

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- 60fps gameplay performance
- Zero deployment failures
- Cross-browser compatibility

### User Experience Metrics
- Intuitive controls
- Smooth gameplay
- Quick restart capability
- Responsive design across devices
